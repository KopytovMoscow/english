I've studied in two schools. My first school was gymnasium 1531. It was near my home, and it is only reason why i studied here. In 1531 we've got a lot of lessons of foreign languages and we learned two languages. In my case it was Englis and French.

In the past education here was good. In 2011 our school was visited by prince Michel Kenntsky(the member of British royal family). The graduate of my schools is Mikhail Prokhorov(buisnessman and politician)

My second school was Lyceum 1581 under BMSTU. It's located in Kurskaya. It's maybe strange but relationships between BMSTU and my schools was the main reason why all my school hate this university. So people from university andministration usually visits our school events, so every firth of september, every last bell we had to listen their speech. Twice a year we went excursions in Baumanka, so everybody were tired of BMSTU.

In 1581 we've 3 profiles. Phisical, Engeneer and IT. So, phisical and engeneer classes were ordinary, but IT class was only for clever pupils, like me. IT profile is a part of governement program "IT class in Moscow schools".

Our graduation was in the БЗДК УЛК
